## Development Environment Setup ##

Here are the setup and install instructions for each of the recommended IDEs for each different OS options:

### Windows ###

For Windows, the recommended IDE is Visual Studio.  Here are the steps required for getting the project up and running using Visual Studio.

1. Download and install [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/)
2. Select *Open Project / Solution* and open `<simulator>/project/Simulator.sln`
3. From the *Project* menu, select the *Retarget solution* option and select the Windows SDK that is installed on your computer (this should have been installed when installing Visual Studio or upon opening of the project).
4. Make sure platform matches the flavor of Windows you are using (x86 or x64). The platform is visible next to the green play button in the Visual Studio toolbar:

5. To compile and run the project / simulator, simply click on the green play button at the top of the screen.  When you run the simulator, you should see a single quadcopter, falling down.


### OS X ###

For Mac OS X, the recommended IDE is XCode, which you can get via the App Store.

1. Download and install XCode from the App Store if you don't already have it installed.
2. Open the project from the `<simulator>/project` directory.
3. After opening project, you need to set the working directory:
  1. Go to *(Project Name)* | *Edit Scheme*
  2. In new window, under *Run/Debug* on left side, under the *Options* tab, set Working Directory to `$PROJECT_DIR` and check ‘use custom working directory’.
  3. Compile and run the project. You should see a single quadcopter, falling down.


### Linux ###

For Linux, the recommended IDE is QtCreator.

1. Download and install QtCreator.
2. Open the `.pro` file from the `<simulator>/project` directory.
3. Compile and run the project (using the tab `Build` select the `qmake` option.  You should see a single quadcopter, falling down.

**NOTE:** You may need to install the GLUT libs using `sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev`


### Advanced Versions ###

These are some more advanced setup instructions for those of you who prefer to use a different IDE or build the code manually.  Note that these instructions do assume a certain level of familiarity with the approach and are not as detailed as the instructions above.

#### CLion IDE ####

For those of you who are using the CLion IDE for developement on your platform, included with the project is the necessary `CMakeLists.txt` file needed to build the simulation.

#### CMake on Linux ####

For those of you interested in doing manual builds using `cmake`, we have provided a `CMakeLists.txt` file with the necessary configuration.

**NOTE: This has only been tested on Ubuntu 16.04, however, these instructions should work for most linux versions.  Also note that these instructions assume knowledge of `cmake` and the required `cmake` dependencies are installed.**

1. Create a new directory for the build files:

```sh
cd 3d-drone-controller
mkdir build
```

2. Navigate to the build directory and run `cmake` and then compile and build the code:

```sh
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

3. You should now be able to run the simulator with `./CPPSim` and you should see a single quadcopter, falling down.

## The Simulator ##

In the simulator window itself, you can right click the window to select between a set of different scenarios that are designed to test the different parts of the controller.

The simulation (including visualization) is implemented in a single thread.  This is so that you can safely breakpoint code at any point and debug, without affecting any part of the simulation.

Due to deterministic timing and careful control over how the pseudo-random number generators are initialized and used, the simulation should be exactly repeatable. This means that any simulation with the same configuration should be exactly identical when run repeatedly or on different machines.

Vehicles are created and graphs are reset whenever a scenario is loaded. When a scenario is reset (due to an end condition such as time or user pressing the ‘R’ key), the config files are all re-read and state of the simulation/vehicles/graphs is reset -- however the number/name of vehicles and displayed graphs are left untouched.

When the simulation is running, you can use the arrow keys on the keyboard to impact forces on the drone to see how the controller reacts to outside forces being applied.

#### Keyboard / Mouse Controls ####

There are a handful of keyboard / mouse commands to help with the simulator itself, including applying external forces on your drone to see how the controllers reacts!

 - Left drag - rotate
 - X + left drag - pan
 - Z + left drag - zoom
 - arrow keys - apply external force
 - C - clear all graphs
 - R - reset simulation
 - Space - pause simulation


## Performance Metrics ##

The specific performance metrics are as follows:

 - scenario 2
   - roll should less than 0.025 radian of nominal for 0.75 seconds (3/4 of the duration of the loop)
   - roll rate should less than 2.5 radian/sec for 0.75 seconds

 - scenario 3
   - X position of both drones should be within 0.1 meters of the target for at least 1.25 seconds
   - Quad2 yaw should be within 0.1 of the target for at least 1 second


 - scenario 4
   - position error for all 3 quads should be less than 0.1 meters for at least 1.5 seconds

 - scenario 5
   - position error of the quad should be less than 0.25 meters for at least 3 seconds
